#### Try `Bạc xỉu` at `Aha Coffee` in `59 Lê Thanh Nghị, Đồng Tâm, Hai Bà Trưng, Hà Nội`.
  View is good, The building at crossroads so I can see more, bikes, cars, traffic lights. In front of have a road with a lot of trees beside. In short, this view is good, but I want more trees. Wifi in here is have enough to use - approximately 66 Mbps download and 89 Mbps upload. I like open view at here, of course, it's not good in summer because very hot, they use misting system to down temperature and more fans. I think structure way suitable for the evening.

  `Bạc xỉu` at here have coffee, milk and lot of foam. It so sweets, just have a little coffee. Maybe it suitable for girl and someone don't like bitter taste of coffee more.
