#### Try `Cafe Nâu Đá` at `Aha Coffee` in `59 Lê Thanh Nghị, Đồng Tâm, Hai Bà Trưng, Hà Nội`.

`Nâu đá` in here not good like `Aha Coffee` at `Số 1 Đình Thôn`. Cafe is so bitter and feel like is roasted too much. So it have bitter aftertaste, I think it should have sweet and little bitter aftertaste is well. Of course, first taste is bitter is good but not like `Nâu đá` this.

I go to here at `13:59` and just have approximately `10 persons`. Because the weather is good, not too hot and not rain so they choose a position near balcony. Just like me.

`Dứa ép` and `Chanh tươi` in here is good, like natural. 

Today I learn `Golang` and a little `Vim` in `2.5 hours` then read book - `When things fall apart`. The book for heal the soul, and provide mindset to pass any pain in life.

#### Try `Bạc xỉu` at `Aha Coffee` in `59 Lê Thanh Nghị, Đồng Tâm, Hai Bà Trưng, Hà Nội`.
  View is good, The building at crossroads so I can see more, bikes, cars, traffic lights. In front of have a road with a lot of trees beside. In short, this view is good, but I want more trees. Wifi in here is have enough to use - approximately 66 Mbps download and 89 Mbps upload. I like open view at here, of course, it's not good in summer because very hot, they use misting system to down temperature and more fans. I think structure way suitable for the evening.

  `Bạc xỉu` at here have coffee, milk and lot of foam. It so sweets, just have a little coffee. Maybe it suitable for girl and someone don't like bitter taste of coffee more.
