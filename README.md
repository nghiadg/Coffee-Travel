#### Try `Rau má đậu xanh` at `Aha Coffee` in `59 Lê Thanh Nghị, Đồng Tâm, Hai Bà Trưng, Hà Nội`

This drink is very well. Maybe, because I like green beans. It has the green color of pennywort and the white of green bean powder. It's is cool, this mean is inside cool. It's not too sweet and I think it can be drunk in the morning instead of food. But I think it can't drunk every day beacause it's so greasy.

#### Try `Nâu đá` at `Aha Coffee` in `59 Lê Thanh Nghị, Đồng Tâm, Hai Bà Trưng, Hà Nội`

When I come at 9:00 am, Aha Coffee had approximately 20 people. Awesome, only one morning, it takes approximately 400.000đ to 500.000đ profit.

Today, I try `Nâu đá` again. This time, It has a mild sour taste and doesn't have bitter so much like the previous one. In short, It's not good.

The air is fresh here although have some vehicles and light wind. I love the open view because it makes me fresh, I love nature.

A bit later, I will try new coffee and update more.

I will try `Cafe cốt dừa` and it's well. I have a taste of coconut and a little bitter of the cafe. It has some form like `Bạc xỉu` but it's better than `Bạc xỉu`. 

I also try `Trà táo bạc hà` but it is simple although the price is high.

Today, I read `When things fall apart` done. But I need read it again because I haven't understand all yet.

#### Try `Cafe Nâu Đá` at `Aha Coffee` in `59 Lê Thanh Nghị, Đồng Tâm, Hai Bà Trưng, Hà Nội`.

`Nâu đá` in here not good like `Aha Coffee` at `Số 1 Đình Thôn`. Cafe is so bitter and feel like is roasted too much. So it have bitter aftertaste, I think it should have sweet and little bitter aftertaste is well. Of course, first taste is bitter is good but not like `Nâu đá` this.

I go to here at `13:59` and just have approximately `10 persons`. Because the weather is good, not too hot and not rain so they choose a position near balcony. Just like me.

`Dứa ép` and `Chanh tươi` in here is good, like natural. 

Today I learn `Golang` and a little `Vim` in `2.5 hours` then read book - `When things fall apart`. The book for heal the soul, and provide mindset to pass any pain in life.

In when the evening, everybody comes here so much. Approximately 15 people, I think so. They talking and meet with their friends.

#### Try `Bạc xỉu` at `Aha Coffee` in `59 Lê Thanh Nghị, Đồng Tâm, Hai Bà Trưng, Hà Nội`.
  View is good, The building at crossroads so I can see more, bikes, cars, traffic lights. In front of have a road with a lot of trees beside. In short, this view is good, but I want more trees. Wifi in here is have enough to use - approximately 66 Mbps download and 89 Mbps upload. I like open view at here, of course, it's not good in summer because very hot, they use misting system to down temperature and more fans. I think structure way suitable for the evening.

  `Bạc xỉu` at here have coffee, milk and lot of foam. It so sweets, just have a little coffee. Maybe it suitable for girl and someone don't like bitter taste of coffee more.
